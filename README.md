# SentiBERT: Twitter Text Summarization and Sentiment Pipeline

SentiBERT is a pipeline designed to process and analyze Twitter data by combining **text summarization** and **sentiment analysis**. Using advanced NLP models and real-time visualization, it enables quick insights into trends, emotions, and key information from large volumes of tweets.

## Features

### ðŸš€ **Text Summarization**
- Powered by **BART Transformer**, achieving an **85% compression ratio**.
- Summarizes over 100 tweets every 30 seconds.

### ðŸ“Š **Sentiment Analysis**
- Uses **TextBlob** for polarity and subjectivity scoring.
- Provides insights into the emotional tone of summarized tweets.
- Achieved **78% accuracy** and an **F1 score of 0.82** during testing.

### ðŸ“ˆ **Interactive Dashboard**
- Built with **Dash** and **Plotly** for real-time visualizations.
- Reduces analysis time by **60%** compared to manual review.
